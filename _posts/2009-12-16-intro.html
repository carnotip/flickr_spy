I am a big fan of Ryan Dahl's node.js. The amount of excitement it gives me
reminds me of Rails excitement back in the days. I started playing with
node.js and dusted off an old idea of making a flickr app that enhances the
activity stream they already provide.

You may ask what is still missing there - after all you get all activity on
your photos or photos you already commented on.

Well, I would also like to know where else are my flickr friends commenting.
This information is scattered among individual comment feeds that are
published automatically by all flickr users. So the only thing I have to do
is combine them and present them in a simple, usable interface.

On technical side, this requires many requests to flickr api and node.js
is a perfect tool for the job.

If everything goes ok, I'd like to post very short notes here, all related to
development of Flickr Spy and node.js itself. Stay tuned!
