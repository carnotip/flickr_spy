I am a big fan of [Ryan Dahl's](http://four.livejournal.com/) 
[node.js](http://nodejs.org). The amount of excitement it gives me reminds
me of Rails excitement back in the days. I started playing with node.js and
dusted off an old idea of making a flickr app that enhances the activity
stream they already provide.

You may ask what is still missing there - after all you get all activity
on your photos or photos you already commented on.

Well, I would also like to know where else are my flickr friends commenting. 
This information is scattered among individual 
[comment feeds](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_comments/) 
that are published automatically by all flickr users. So the only thing I have
to do is combine them and present them in a simple, usable interface.

A 
[similar solution](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=1vmbb0k33bgh1mxjeppzna) 
already exists but is fairly limited. I shamelessly stole the name, I admit.

On technical side, this requires many requests to flickr api and node.js is 
a perfect tool for the job.

If everything goes ok, I'd like to post very short notes here, all related to
development of [Flickr Spy](http://github.com/ncr/flickr_spy) and node.js 
itself. Stay tuned!
