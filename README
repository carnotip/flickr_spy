Flickr Spy

Not really a web app yet but a command line utility.

1. Install node.js from http://nodejs.org
2. Run with: node server.js your_flickr_nickname number_of_simultaneous_connections.
3. Or just: node server.js
4. Enjoy dozens of simultaneous connections without any blocking. Enjoy the event loop!

Thanks to Ryan Dahl for node.js.
